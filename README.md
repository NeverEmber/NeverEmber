Hi, I’m @NeverEmber.
I’m interested in tree/prestige games.
I’m currently learning JavaScript.
I’m looking to collaborate on a multi-layer tree game. If you want to help, you can email me at stefanericanderson@gmail.com.
Feel free to reach out with any questions or suggestions for what I should do!
